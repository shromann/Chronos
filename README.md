# Chronos

(Currently in progress)

[Chronos](link/to/web_app) is an ML Scheduler Tool, helping students to block and manage time with minimal manual intervention. It adapts to a users cognitive peaks and troughs in a day and suggests appropriate times for thier events.

Our mission is to promote a healthy work life balance by placing appropriate times to thier events in an automated fasion. We use user feed back to model the user's [Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest%E2%80%93activity_cycle) to use as a basis. 

Some key AI features we provide are,
1. Event Filler: given a fixed number of hours per week, automatically fill in time with super flexible events
2. Time Blocking: move events around to make free sufficient space of a chunk of time
3. Suggestions: suggest appropriate times for events of particular category
